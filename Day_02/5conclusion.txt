SUMMARY:-

In terms of OOP, delimiting of the internal interface from the external one is called encapsulation.

It gives the following benefits:
Protection for users, so that they don’t shoot themselves in the foot

Imagine, there’s a team of developers using a coffee machine. It was made by the “Best CoffeeMachine” company, 
and works fine, but a protective cover was removed. So the internal interface is exposed.

All developers are civilized – they use the coffee machine as intended. But one of them, John, 
decided that he’s the smartest one, and made some tweaks in the coffee machine internals.
 So the coffee machine failed two days later.

That’s surely not John’s fault, but rather the person who removed the protective cover and 
let John do his manipulations.

The same in programming. If a user of a class will change things not intended to be 
changed from the outside – the consequences are unpredictable.
