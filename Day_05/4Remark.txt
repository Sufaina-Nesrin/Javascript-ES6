                     the operators that may confuses

In regular expressions, the * operator is a quantifier that matches zero or more occurrences 
of the preceding element. Here are some examples to illustrate how the * operator works:
for example:-
The regular expression a* matches zero or more occurrences of the letter "a". 
This means that it would match the string "a", "aa", "aaa", and so on, but also an empty string 
(since zero occurrences of "a" is still a valid match).

In regular expressions, the + operator is a quantifier that matches one or more occurrences 
of the preceding element. Here are some examples to illustrate how the + operator works:
for example:-
The regular expression a+ matches one or more occurrences of the letter "a". 
This means that it would match the string "a", "aa", "aaa", and so on, but not an empty string 
(since it requires at least one occurrence of "a" to be a valid match).
.............................................................................................................

The ? operator is a quantifier in regular expressions that matches zero or one occurrence of the 
preceding element. 
It essentially makes the preceding element optional.
Here are some examples of how the ? operator can be used in regular expressions:
/colou?r/ matches "color" or "colour"

A positive lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it.
 A positive lookahead is used as (?=...) where the ... is the required part that is not matched.
On the other hand, a negative lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there.
 A negative lookahead is used as (?!...) where the ... is the pattern that you do not want to be there. 
 The rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lookahead part is not present.

A more practical use of lookaheads is to check two or more patterns in one string. 
Here is a (naively) simple password checker that looks for between 3 and 6 characters and at least one number:

/(?=\w{3,6})(?=\D*\d)/

it is the format of password like
Contains only word characters (letters, digits, or underscores)
Has a length between 3 and 6 characters inclusive
Contains at least one digit

(?=\w+{3,6}) - Positive lookahead that checks if the string contains only word characters 
and has a length between 3 and 6 characters inclusive. \w+ matches one or 
more word characters (letter, digit, or underscore) and {3,6} specifies that it should occur between 3 and 6 times.
(?=\D*\d) - Positive lookahead that checks if the string contains at least 
one digit. \D* matches any number of non-digit characters (including zero) and \d matches a digit.

Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses ()

there is a condition:-
Franklin D. Roosevelt,Eleanor Roosevelt,Franklin Rosevelt,Frank Roosevelt,FranklinRoosevelt,EleanorRoosevelt
return true when test

here first we have to find the common properties ,then the variations

/(Franklin|Eleanor) (([A-Z]\.?|[A-Z][a-z]+) )?Roosevelt/

.............................................................................................................
it seems easy,but when we write a particular code for a particular condition its get little dizzy.
that 's not matter, try more questions .it will improve your thinking and solving capacity
here is an example to write regularExpression for decimal or non decimal numbers:-

/\d+\.?\d*/
\d+ :defines a digit at lest one occurence(1,23,4....,but not an empty)
\.? :defines \. is for . and ? for optional then colloborating these two we get . is optional
\d* :defines after . operatot there will be \d digit and * is defines the occurence 
will be zero or more (means it can be empty)

cool right?

You need to check all the usernames in a database. 
Here are some simple rules that users have to follow when creating their username.

Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.

The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end.
 Username cannot start with the number.

Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.

Usernames have to be at least two characters long. 
A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.

/^[a-z][a-z]+\d*$|[a-z]+\d\d+$/i

lets break into small parts to understand

^ matches the start of the string.

[a-z] matches a single lowercase letter.

[a-z]+ matches one or more lowercase letters.

\d* matches zero or more digits.

$ matches the end of the string.

| is the "alternation" operator, which means "OR".

[a-z]+ matches one or more lowercase letters.

\d\d+ matches two or more digits.

$ matches the end of the string.

i is a flag that makes the regular expression case-insensitive, 
so it will match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

.............................................................................................................
/^[-+]?((\.\d+)|\d+(\.d*)?)$/

This regular expression matches a string that represents a number, with optional positive or 
negative signs, an optional decimal point,

/^[a-z]+\d*@gmail\.com/i
